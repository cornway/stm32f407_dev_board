;* Description        : STM32F407xx devices vector table for MDK-ARM toolchain. 
;*                      This module performs:
;*                      - Set the initial SP
;*                      - Set the initial PC == Reset_Handler
;*                      - Set the vector table entries with the exceptions ISR address
;*                      - Branches to __main in the C library (which eventually
;*                        calls main()).
;*                      After Reset the CortexM4 processor is in Thread mode,
;*                      priority is Privileged, and the Stack is set to Main.
